Stacks can be implemented using Arrays, ArrayList or LinkedList.

Arrays - Since arrays are fixes size, stack will be of fixed size. 
Use the last index as the the top of the stack.

ArrayList - variable size stack.
LinkedList - head will be top.

Notes from A.V Playlist
If there is an arrays problem where time complexity is O(N^2), where the 2nd loop j is dependent on the first loop i then there will be an improvised version of this problem using stacks.
